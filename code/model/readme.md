## About

This directory holds everything related to the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) classifier. It holds the trainining and testing scripts as well as the model checkpoints and logs. The code is implemented such that it can be re-used for different pytorch model training projects.

## Usage

### Training

```bash
python train.py
```

configurations can be changed in the [config.json](https://github.com/julianderks/Classifying-Fashion-Articles/tree/main/model/config/config.json).
model checkpoints and logs are stored in the [saved directory](https://github.com/julianderks/Classifying-Fashion-Articles/tree/main/model/saved).

### Testing

TO DO - finalize a working testing script and make structural changes.
